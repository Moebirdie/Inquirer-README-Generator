## Description
This application is designed for generating a professional README file.. I chose this project because creating a professional README is an important part of a repository..
The skills used for developing this application include Inquirer, node.js.

I chose these tools because Inquirer is a prompt package that can easily handle the creation of a command line prompt application. 

Some of the challenges I faced were:
1. The flexibilty to create more complex scenarios that could potentially be resolved with a different package.
2. The personal conflict that a good README could be generated via a prompt system.

I am of a strong opinion that a README captures the essence of the developer's project of which intricacies can only be captured when creating a free style README.  A README should be re-worked until the developer feels comfortable that it truly reflects the purpose and skillset of the project.
