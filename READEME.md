## Description

This application was designed to create a professional README file for a gitHub repository.. I chose this project because every good repository/project needs a professional README file..
The skills used for developing this application include node.js, inquirer package, screencastify and an understanding of process flow..

I chose these tools because Inquirer is a prompt based package and believe that prompt based technology is the best type of package to use to simplify the process for an end user. Node.js is a powerful command line tool that enables us to utilize the Inquirer package.  Within the Inquirer package I used the input prompt, editor prompt, confirm prompt, conditional statements and list prompt.  

I faced many challenges creating this application.  The basic technology was not an issue, but wanting to manipulate Inquirer beyond it's capabilities was an issue for me.  I had difficulties staying within scope to create a simple README file where one size fits all. I am of a strong opinion that a README should not just be a standardized list of questions answered with each creation of an application, but should enhance the end user's understanding of the application. For example, I feel strongly that a good README should always have a visual description for readers who conceptualize better via visual representation.  On the other hand, I used an editor prompt for the why and challenges section of the project because the communication of these is critical to the reader to assess whether this project correlates to what they are looking for.  Although using Inquirer assisted in the creation of a README, I felt I was somewhat limited with the resulting diversity in the outcome of my README.  This is a purely personal opinion and not a criticism of any package.
